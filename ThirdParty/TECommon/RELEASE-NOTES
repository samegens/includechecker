Release Notes for te-common.NET 2.1-pre1 (Month Day, Year)
====================================================

This is the initial release of the .NET port of the library.

This release includes both binary and source versions of the project.
Also included with each of the distribution files should have been a
copy of the software LICENSE.


Using the Binary Release
------------------------

The entire library is distributed as a single assembly.  You should
only need to place the assembly in your system path and all of the
code should be accessible to your .NET environment.

Building the Source Release
---------------------------

Building the source distribution requires only a .NET command line
compiler.  This distribution has been developed and tested with both
Mono (0.29) and the Microsoft .NET Framework (1.1).

Currently, the library uses a single Makefile because there is nothing
complicated about the build (you can even do it by hand).  Detailed
instructions for using Make are included in the Makefile.

Once the project has been built, it may be used by following the
instructions in the 'Using the Binary Release' section.


Reporting Bugs
--------------

Bugs and other problems may be directed to the te-code-users mailing
list hosted on SourceForge.


Latest Releases
---------------

The latest version of the code is always available via SourceForge's
anonymous CVS facilities.  Information on accessing the project source
code can be found at http://te-code.sourceforge.net.
