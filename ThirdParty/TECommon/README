README for TE-Common.NET

This directory contains the C# source for parts of the
TE-Common library.  At the moment, the only parts of the
library which are ported is the command-line argument
handling.

I originally tried to not do this project and instead use
the Microsoft Java Conversion Assistant to automagically
generate a .NET version.  Unfortunately, there were a number
of issues with this approach.

The code in this project started as a line-by-line port of
the equivalent Java version of the library (TE_COMMON_CMBUILD_74),
so it should include any bugs present in the Java version.
Hopefully, I haven't introduced too many new ones specific
to this implementation as this is my first serious C#
programming effort.
